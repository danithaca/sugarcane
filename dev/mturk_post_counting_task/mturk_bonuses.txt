Thanks for your work on my "Check how many posts this blog post has" task!  I appreciate the care you put into making sure the results are really accurate.  There are still more HITs to complete -- I hope you'll be able to do some more.

Hi!  This is probably the only time you'll ever get a bonus for getting a HIT wrong.  The goal on this task is to count all the posts in the *whole blog*, not just the front page.  I mistakenly approved your first couple HITs, even though they were done incorrectly, and it looks like that gave you the wrong idea about the task.  I know you've put in a bunch of effort on later HITs, so it will be disappointing to see them rejected.  This bonus is to say thank you for the work you put in, and to clear up the misunderstanding on the goal of the task.  Please feel free to keep working on these HITs, but make sure to tally posts from the whole blog, not just the front page.  Thanks!  - Abe
