				<p>On July 21, 2010, New York Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo <a title="Sodexo Settlement Announcement" href="http://www.ag.ny.gov/media_center/2010/july/july21a_10.html" target="_blank">announced</a> that the State had reached a $20 million settlement with Sodexo, one of the world&#8217;s largest food services companies, to resolve allegations that the company violated the New York False Claims Act by overcharging New York schools.&#160; The State&#8217;s lawsuit asserted that for approximately 5 years Sodexo overcharged New York school districts and the SUNY system for food services by failing to pass significant rebates Sodexo received from its food suppliers, as required by the State&#8217;s child nutrition programs and the National School Lunch Program.</p>
<p>The <a title="About Qui Tam Cases" href="http://www.fraudfighters.net/faqs/what-is-a-qui-tam-case/" target="_blank">qui tam</a> case was brought on behalf of New York by <a title="More Information For Whistleblowers" href="http://www.fraudfighters.net/" target="_blank">whistleblowers</a> that were former Sodexo employees.&#160; The settlement is the largest monetary recovery for a case brought under the New York False Claims Act that did not involve Medicaid Funds.&#160; As a reward for disclosing Sodexo&#8217;s fraud, the whistleblowers received a $3.6 million share of the settlement.</p>

				<p>On September 28, 2010, the Supreme Court of the United States granted certiorari in <em>Schindler Elevator Corp. v. United States</em>, Dkt. No. 10-188.&#160; The sole issue before the Court is &#8220;[w]hether a federal agency&#8217;s response to a Freedom of Information Act request is a &#8216;report . . . or investigation&#8217; within the meaning of the False Claims Act public disclosure bar, 31 U.S.C. &#167; 3730(e)(4).&#8221;</p>
<p>Plaintiff Daniel Kirk is a Vietnam War veteran and former employee of Defendant Schindler Elevator Corporation.&#160; Schindler is an elevator and moving walkway manufacturer and servicer that entered into numerous contracts with the U.S. Government.&#160; The Vietnam Era Veterans Readjustment Assistance Act (&#8220;VEVRAA&#8221;) is a federal statute that imposes several requirements on government contracts that exceed a certain monetary threshold.&#160; Specifically, contracts subject to VEVRAA must contain provisions obligating contractors to 1) take affirmative action to employ and advance in employment qualified veterans; 2) invite eligible veterans to voluntarily identify themselves to their employer; and 3) submit annual reports to the Department of Labor (&#8220;VETS-100 reports&#8221;) providing data about the veterans in the contractor&#8217;s workforce, including the number of veterans, veterans in each job category, hiring location, and the number of new hires that are veterans.</p>
<p>Kirk had been employed with Schindler since 1989 and was eventually promoted Regional Modernization Manager for New York City and Long Island.&#160; But in July 2003 he was demoted to the non-managerial position of Field Superintendent and later resigned from Schindler in August 2003.&#160; In March 2005, Kirk filed the instant <em>qui tam</em> action on behalf of the Government in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging that Schindler entered into many contracts with the Government that were subject to the requirements of VEVRAA, but that the company failed to comply with the statute.&#160;&#160; According to Kirk, during his time at Schindler he was never asked to voluntarily identify himself as a veteran and that there was no affirmative action program for aiding veterans, as required by VEVRAA.</p>
<p>Kirk also alleged that Schindler failed to submit all the VETS-100 reports it was required to submit under VEVRAA and that the reports that were submitted contained false representations.&#160; Kirk, however, had little personal knowledge with respect to this failure.&#160; Instead, the facts demonstrating this VEVRAA violation were gleaned largely from FOIA requests submitted by Kirk&#8217;s wife to the Department of Labor (&#8220;DOL&#8221;).&#160; The DOL&#8217;s response to the FOIA requests allegedly revealed that from 1998 to 2003 Schindler failed to submit the VETS-100 reports.&#160; This allegation was based on letters from the DOL in response to the FOIA requests that stated that the agency was unable to locate VETS-100 reports for these years.&#160; The lawsuit also alleged that Schindler filed false reports in 2002, 2004, 2005, and 2006.&#160;&#160; The DOL located and produced the VETS-100 reports for these four years in response to Mrs. Kirk&#8217;s FOIA requests.&#160;&#160; According to Kirk, the statements in these reports were false based on his own personal knowledge of the company&#8217;s operations.</p>
<p>The Complaint came out from under seal in June 2007, after the Government decided not to intervene.&#160; Schindler then filed its motion to dismiss the lawsuit in September 2007, which the district court granted on March 30, 2009.&#160; The district court first found that Kirk had failed to state a claim with respect to Schindler&#8217;s alleged filing of false or inaccurate reports because Schindler never certified the accuracy of these reports.&#160; With regard to Kirk&#8217;s remaining claims, the district court held that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to consider them because they were based on FOIA reports that constituted a &#8220;public disclosure&#8221; under 31 U.S.C. &#167; 3730(e)(4)(A), which provides that:</p>
<p>No court shall have jurisdiction over an action under [the FCA] based upon the public disclosure of allegations or transactions in a criminal, civil, or administrative hearing, in a congressional, administrative, or Government Accounting Office report, hearing, audit, or investigation, or from the news media, unless the action is brought by the Attorney General or the person bringing the action is an original source of the information.<a href="index.html#_edn1">[i]</a></p>
<p>Kirk appealed the district court&#8217;s decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which ultimately concluded that the lower court&#8217;s decision was erroneous.&#160; Most of the appellate court&#8217;s opinion was devoted to the issue of whether it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the claims due to the public disclosure bar.&#160; The appellate court began its discussion by holding that information produced in response to a FOIA request becomes a &#8220;public disclosure&#8221; within the meaning of &#167; 3730(e)(4)(A) once it is received by the requester.</p>
<p>But that did not end the inquiry.&#160; The appellate court went on to explain that not only must the documents have been disclosed to the public, but that they must also qualify as one of the enumerated sources of information set forth in &#167; 3730(e)(4)(A) .&#160; The appellate court stated that the potentially applicable categories with respect to FOIA documents are &#8220;administrative,&#8221; &#8220;report,&#8221; or &#8220;investigation.&#8221;&#160;&#160; The court acknowledged that the Second Circuit had not addressed this issue and that other circuits were split along two different lines.&#160; The majority of circuits that had addressed the issue followed the Third Circuit&#8217;s opinion in <em>United States ex rel. Mistick PBT v. Hous. Auth. Of Pittsburgh</em>, 186 F.3d 376 (3d Cir. 1999), authored by now Justice Samuel Alito.&#160; Relying primarily on dictionary definitions, the Third Circuit construed the terms of the statute broadly so that a response to a FOIA request is <em>always</em> a &#8220;report&#8221; or &#8220;investigation&#8221; under &#167; 3730(e)(4)(A) .</p>
<p>A minority of circuits, however, agreed with the reasoning in <em>United States ex. rel. Haight v. Catholic Healthcare West</em>, 445 F.3f 1147 (9<sup>th</sup> Cir. 2006).&#160; Instead of relying on dictionary definitions to construe the terms &#8220;report&#8221; and &#8220;investigation,&#8221; the Ninth Circuit looked at the words in the context of the statute as a whole and with reference to the legislative history of the statute. &#160;Based on this review, the Ninth Circuit concluded that the terms refer to work product that represents governmental analysis or &#8220;leg-work&#8221;, rather than the &#8220;mechanistic production of documents that follows upon a FOIA request.&#8221;&#160; Thus, determining whether documents obtained via a FOIA request fall within an enumerated source within the meaning of &#167; 3730(e)(4)(A) requires a case-by-case analysis of the nature of the documents.</p>
<p>The Second Circuit agreed with the minority view expressed in <em>Haight </em>and concluded that if a document reflects the Government&#8217;s efforts to compile or synthesize information for its own investigative purposes, then it would constitute a &#8220;report&#8221; or &#8220;investigation&#8221; within the meaning of the public disclosure bar.&#160; And &#8220;[t]he mere fact that a government agency has assembled and duplicated records, or noted the absence of records, in responding to a FOIA request does not itself render the material produced an &#8216;administrative . . . report . . . or investigation&#8217; within the meaning of &#167; 3730(e)(4)(A).&#8221;</p>
<p>The Second Circuit also held that the district court erred in finding that Kirk failed to state a claim with regard to Schindler&#8217;s filing of false or inaccurate reports.&#160; The only issued appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, however, was whether the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to the public disclosure bar since Kirk&#8217;s claims were based on documents produced in response to a FOIA request.</p>
<p>Because the language of &#167; 3730(e)(4)(A) was amended in 2009, the impact of the Supreme Court&#8217;s decision is not likely to be significant on cases filed after the effective date of the changes.&#160; But depending on how the Supreme Court rules, the Court could cause a number of meritorious FCA lawsuits filed prior to the amendments to the public disclosure bar to be dismissed on jurisdictional grounds.&#160; For instance, in many cases the whistleblower may be an insider with actual knowledge of fraud perpetrated on the Government, but who sought documents via FOIA to obtain additional evidence in support of the whistleblower&#8217;s personal knowledge.&#160;&#160; Kirk is a good example:&#160; he was an employee with insider knowledge of his employer&#8217;s alleged deliberate failure to comply with applicable regulations covering government contracts, but used FOIA to gather additional documentary evidence to substantiate the fraud he observed.&#160; Dismissal of cases like this is not consistent with the FCA&#8217;s intent to incentivize whistleblowers to come forward and disclose fraud on the Government.&#160; Nor is it in keeping with the intent of the public disclosure bar itself, which was designed to prevent parasitic lawsuits based on public allegations of fraud that the Government already knew about.&#160; FOIA is merely a mechanism for production of documents in the Government&#8217;s possession.&#160; In responding to a FOIA request, Government officials review their files to see if the Government has the requested information, determine whether the documents are privileged, and photocopy the documents to be produced.&#160; None of this means that the Government is aware of the fraud against it or that the documents produced in response to the FOIA request would even reveal the fraud to the Government.&#160; Indeed, in Kirk&#8217;s case the Government could not have discovered Schindler&#8217;s alleged fraud by responding to the FOIA requests because it was Kirk&#8217;s own personal knowledge regarding Schindler&#8217;s failure to comply with VEVRAA that gave rise to the allegations of fraud.</p>
<p>The Second Circuit&#8217;s opinion strikes the right balance.&#160; If the documents produced in response to FOIA reflect a Government investigation or analysis, then an FCA lawsuit based on such documents should be barred.&#160; The mere fact that a document was obtained by a whistleblower through the mechanical process of responding to a FOIA request should not trigger the public disclosure bar.&#160; The Supreme Court should affirm the Second Circuit&#8217;s decision.</p>

<p><a href="index.html#_ednref1">[i]</a> Section 3730(e)(4)(A) was recently amended by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Pub. L. 111-148 (2010).&#160; But because the amendments were not retroactive, the court did not address the impact of the new language upon this case.</p>

<p>In 2002 Taledo Corp., based in Dublin California, subcontracted with CPS Human Resources to provide supporting software in a job CPS had with TSA.&#160; Taledo stated in its subcontract that it would charge its commercial list rates with some discounts.&#160; According to the allegations, Taledo&#8217;s commercial list rates were based on a customer&#8217;s number of employees, but Taledo charged TSA a rate that was not based on this number.&#160; If Taledo had based its rate on the agency&#8217;s number of employees, the rate they charged TSA would have been lower.&#160;</p>
<p>&#160;The <a title="Qui Tam Information" href="http://www.fraudfighters.net/faqs/what-is-a-qui-tam-case/" target="_blank">qui tam</a> lawsuit was brought on behalf of the government under the <a title="False Claims Act Information" href="http://www.fraudfighters.net/faqs/what-is-the-false-claims-act/" target="_blank">False Claims Act </a>by a former employee who blew the whistle on Taledo Corp&#8217;s fraudulent behavior.</p>

				<p>On May 6, 2010, the U.S. Department of Justice <a title="DOJ Announcement Regarding Ciena Capital" href="http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2010/May/10-civ-532.html" target="_blank">announced</a> that it had entered into a settlement agreement with Ciena Capital LLC, a private lender located in New York City, to resolve allegations in a lawsuit brought under the <a title="About the False Claims Act" href="http://www.fraudfighters.net/faqs/what-is-the-false-claims-act/" target="_blank">False Claims Act</a> that the company submitted false claims for payment on <a title="Types of Federal Loan Fraud" href="http://www.fraudfighters.net/false-claims-act-fraud/federal-loan-fraud/" target="_blank">loans</a> backed by the Small Business Administration (SBA).&#160; The SBA provides financial aid to small businesses by guaranteeing as much as 85% of the value of loans made by private lenders.&#160; According to the lawsuit, Ciena falsely certified that it had complied with SBA regulations when it submitted claims for payment on loans the company underwrote.&#160; A number of the loans defaulted shortly after they were made as a result of Ciena&#8217;s failure to comply with SBA regulations and underwriting requirements.</p>
<p>The <em><a title="About Qui Tam Cases" href="http://www.fraudfighters.net/faqs/what-is-a-qui-tam-case/" target="_blank">qui tam</a></em> lawsuit was filed on behalf of the Government by a whistleblower.&#160; The whistleblower received a $4.3 million share of the settlement as a reward for disclosing the fraud to the Government.</p>

				<p>The Congressional Research Service (&#8220;CRS&#8221;), which is part of the Library of Congress, has issued a report titled &#8220;The False Claims Act, the <em>Allison Engine</em> Decision, and Possible Effect on Health Care Fraud Enforcements.&#8221;&#160; The report points out that the Supreme Court&#8217;s decision in&#160;<em><span><span>Allison Engine Co., Inc. v. United States ex rel. Sanders </span></span></em>has created the risk that certain False Claims Act cases alleging fraud on the Medicare or Medicaid systems could be dismissed because, in some circumstances, health care providers make their claims for payment to either private entities or state-run entities, and not directly to the federal government.&#160; The report also points out that this might <em>not</em> happen; it all depends on what <em>Allison Engine</em> really means.&#160; (For our view on that, see our July 18, 2008 post.)&#160; But the real purpose of the&#160;CRS report is to add some fuel to the fire now burning fairly hot in Congress for passage of the False Claims Correction Act, which would effectively overrule the dangerous parts of the <em>Allison Engine</em> decision.&#160; (Believe it or not, the CRS does not make its reports publicly available on a website.&#160; But if you&#8217;d like a copy of the CRS report, get in touch with us, and we&#8217;ll send it to you.)</p>

				<p>On October 5, 2009, the Governor of Connecticut signed into law Connecticut&#226;&#128;&#153;s False Claims Act (&#226;&#128;&#156;CFCA&#226;&#128;&#157;), Connecticut General Statutes &#194;&#167;&#194;&#167; 17b-301, <em>et seq</em>.&#194;&#160; The CFCA is modeled after the federal <a title="What Is The False Claims Act?" href="http://www.fraudfighters.net/faqs/what-is-the-false-claims-act/" target="_blank">False Claims Act</a>, although it is narrower in scope.&#194;&#160; It prohibits the presentation of a false for fraudulent claim for payment or approval to medical-assistance programs administered by Connecticut&#226;&#128;&#153;s Department of Social Services, such as State-Administered General Assistance, HUSKY B, and Charter Oak.&#194;&#160; In addition, the act provides for penalties of $5,000 to $10,000 per false claim and authorizes the recovery of up to triple the amount of actual damages sustained by the State as due to the false claims.&#194;&#160; The CFCA&#226;&#128;&#153;s <a title="Whistleblower Rewards" href="http://www.fraudfighters.net/faqs/what-are-the-potential-rewards/" target="_blank">whistleblower reward provisions</a> also track the federal False Claims Act:&#194;&#160; affording the whistleblower 15% to 25% of the State&#226;&#128;&#153;s recovery in cases in which the State intervened and 25% to 30% of the State&#226;&#128;&#153;s recovery in cases in which the State did not intervene.&#194;&#160; Connecticut now joins the list of at least twenty other states that have enacted their own false claims act.</p>

				<p class="MsoNormal"><span>The state of Alabama has been actively pursuing various pharmaceutrical companies for fraudulently overcharging the Medicaid program for drugs.&#160; The first case to go to trial was against AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP.&#160; A jury found in favor of the state, and awarded $40 million in compensatory damages, and $175 million in punitive damages.&#160; The trial judge recently cut the punitive damage award down to $120 million, reasoning that Alabama state law limited punitive damages to an amount equal to three times the compensatory damages.&#160; So, the total judgment against AstraZeneca will be $160 million.&#160;&#160; The Associated Press <a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/080619/drug_suit.html?.v=3" target="_blank">quoted</a> AstraZeneca spokesperson Laura Woodin&#160;as stating &#8220;AstraZeneca has fully complied with the law.&#8221;&#160; But, of course, this is what corporate spokespeople<em><span>&#160;</span></em>usually&#160;say when their companies are caught <em>not</em> complying with the law.</span></p>

				<p>On November 18, 2009, the U.S. Department of Justice <a title="$3 Million Settlement For New Jersey Hospital Medicare Fraud" href="http://newark.fbi.gov/dojpressrel/2009/nk111809.htm" target="_blank">announced</a> that it had reached an agreement with New Jersey based Trinitas Regional Medical Center to resolve allegations in a <a title="Description of Qui Tam Case" href="http://www.fraudfighters.net/faqs/#Q1" target="_blank">qui tam lawsuit</a> that the hospital submitted <a title="Medicare Fraud Under False Claims Act" href="http://www.fraudfighters.net/aop/Medicaid-Medicare-fraud/">false Medicare claims</a> in violation of the <a title="http://www.fraudfighters.net/false-claims-act/" href="http://" target="_blank">False Claims Act</a>.&#160;&#160;Besides its regular reimbursement system, Medicare also offers supplemental &#8220;outlier payments&#8221; to health-care providers in cases where the cost of care is abnormally high. The payments are intended to incentivize providers to treat patients where the cost of care will be unusually expensive. The lawsuit alleged that Trinitas inflated its charges to obtain outlier payments for cases in which the actual cost of care was not unusually high and outlier payments should not have been available. In exchange for bringing the alleged fraud to the government&#8217;s attention, the whistleblower will receive approximately $679,000 with interest out of the total settlement.</p>

				<p>The U.S. Attorney&#8217;s office for the District of Connecticut announced last week that it had entered into a settlement with Yale University. The university paid $7.6 million to the government based upon claims that it had violated the False Claims Act and other laws. The government alleged the Yale misused research grant money it received from approximately 30 federal agencies in two distinct ways from 2000 to 2006. The first alleged misuse was that certain Yale researchers improperly charged expenditures to federal grant accounts when those charges did not specifically relate to the grant project. The other allegation was that some researchers charged 100% of their time to federal grant accounts when, in fact, much of their work was on unrelated projects.</p>
<p>The five government agencies responsible for the bulk of the grants to Yale are the Department of Health and Human Services, the National Science Foundation, the Department of Energy, the Department of Defense, and NASA. In the six years the allegations dealt with, Yale received almost $3 billion in federal grant funding.</p>

				<p>Senator Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) recently introduced the &#8220;<a title="More Information About Senate Bill 2964" href="http://grassley.senate.gov/news/Article.cfm?customel_dataPageID_1502=25015" target="_blank">Strengthening Program Integrity and Accountability Health Act</a>&#8221; (S. 2964) in the Senate, which aims at curbing fraud, waste, and abuse in <a title="More Information About Types Of Health Care Fraud" href="http://www.fraudfighters.net/false-claims-act-fraud/healthcare-fraud/" target="_blank">Medicare, Medicaid, and the Children&#8217;s Health Insurance Program</a>.&#160; The bill includes provisions to:</p>
<ul><li>Enhance government screening of healthcare providers to keep fraudulent providers from participating in federal programs from the outset;</li>
<li>Extend the amount of time government agencies have to evaluate the legitimacy of Medicare providers before payment on a claim is required when waste and abuse by the provider is suspected;</li>
<li>Increase disclosure requirements by healthcare providers;</li>
<li>Improve information sharing among federal agencies responsible for fighting fraud; and</li>
<li>Enhance government enforcement capabilities by enlarging the range of activities subject to penalties, while also increasing existing penalties.</li>
</ul><p>In addition, the bill includes amendments to the <a title="More Information About The False Claims Act" href="http://www.fraudfighters.net/false-claims-act-fraud/" target="_blank">False Claims Act </a>(FCA) to counter recent federal court decisions that reduced the FCA&#8217;s scope and applicability.&#160; For instance, the bill would amend the &#8220;original source&#8221; exception to the public disclosure bar to allow <a title="Frequently Asked Questions About Who Can Bring A Whistleblower Lawsuit" href="http://www.fraudfighters.net/faqs/" target="_blank">whistleblowers</a> to proceed with an FCA case that includes allegations of fraud that were publicly disclosed if the whistleblower reported the fraud to the Government prior to the disclosure or if the whistleblower provides information to the Government that &#8220;materially adds&#8221; to the publicly disclosed allegations.</p>

				<p>On October 13, 2009, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) announced that AT&amp;T Missouri has agreed to pay $1.4 million to settle a civil lawsuit alleging that the company violated the False Claims Act by submitting false information and engaging in anticompetitive practices in connection with the Federal Communication Commission&#8217;s E-Rate Program.&#160; The E-Rate program provides funds for schools and libraries to assist them in connecting to and using the Internet and is resourced through fees collected from telephone users.&#160; The non-competitive practices alleged by the DOJ included that AT&amp;T Missouri colluded with Kansas City, Missouri school district officials to obtain and extend contracts under the E-Rate program and that the company provided meals and other inducements to these officials.&#160; AT&amp;T Missouri&#8217;s alleged misconduct came to light through a False Claims Act lawsuit filed in Missouri federal court by American Fiber Systems Inc., which submitted an unsuccessful bid to the school district for E-Rate contracts that were ultimately awarded to AT&amp;T Missouri.&#160; American Fiber acted as a <a title="Qui Tam Whistleblower Information" href="http://fraudfighters.net/aop/qui-tam/" target="_self">qui tam relator</a>, and received $195,000 as its share for blowing the whistle on this fraud.&#160; For more information, see the DOJ <a title="DOJ Press Release Qui Tam Settlement" href="http://www.usdoj.gov/opa/pr/2009/October/09-civ-1099.html" target="_blank">press release</a> regarding the settlement.</p>

				<p>California&#8217;s Attorney General has joined a whistleblower lawsuit brought under the California state False Claims Act against seven laboratories accused of overcharging Medi-Cal, the state&#8217;s low income healthcare program, and providing illegal kickbacks over the last 15 years. Chris Riedel was the original <em>qui tam</em> plaintiff, and the lawsuit only recently became public. Riedel is the CEO of Hunter Laboratories, a company that found it impossible to compete with the seven laboratories in question, which it alleges offered providers reduced rates to private customers in exchange for referring Medi-Cal customers who were, in turn, charged inflated prices.</p>
<p>The defendants include Quest Diagnostics, the nation&#8217;s top provider of diagnostic testing (along with five of its affiliates), and Laboratory Corporation of America, a company that performs over a million tests on 400,000 samples per day. Health Line Clinical Laboratories Inc., Westcliff Medical Laboratories Inc., Physicians Immunodiagnostic Laboratory Inc., Whitefield Medical Laboratory Inc., and Seacliffs Diagnostics Medical Group round out the defendants.</p>
<p>The lawsuit alleges that the laboratories gave providers significant discounted prices for private patients in exchange for the referral of Medi-Cal patients, who the labs charged up to six times the discounted prices. According to California law, this sort of arrangement constitutes an illegal kickback. Even absent the kickbacks, state law dictates that Medi-Cal is not to be charged a higher prices than non-Medi-Cal consumers would pay for comparable services. A few of the more egregious price increases alleged include the following:</p>
<p>-          Quest charged Medi-Cal $8.59 for a complete blood count test (CBC), a test for which other customers paid only $1.43.</p>
<p>-          Laboratory Corporation billed Medi-Cal $30.09 for a Hepatitis C Antibody screening, while some others customers paid as little as $6.44.</p>
<p>-          Health Line charged $12.65 for an HIV Antibody screening, a service some other customers were billed prices as low as $1.75.</p>
<p>While some of the defendants do all of their business in California, others are national companies, so the results of this case could have far-reaching implications.</p>

				<p>On September 2, 2009, the <a href="http://www.doj.gov" target="_blank">U.S. Department Of Justice </a>announced that it had reached an agreement with pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., and its subsidiary Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn Company, to settle allegations that the company unlawfully marketed some of its prescription drugs.&#160; Pfizer agreed to pay a total of $2.3 billion to resolve both civil and criminal violations, including $1 billion to resolve allegations under the civil <a href="http://fraudfighters.net/false" target="_blank">False Claims Act</a>.&#160; According to the Justice Department, Pfizer improperly marketed four drugs (Bextra, Geodon, Zyvox, and Lyrica) for uses that were not medically accepted &#8212; a practice known as &#8220;off-label marketing&#8221; &#8211;&#160;causing false claims to be submitted to government health care programs.&#160; Among the allegations were that Pfizer paid illegal kickbacks to health care providers to induce them to prescribe these drugs.</p>
<p>&#160;The Justice Department&#8217;s investigation of Pfizer stemmed from information provided by six qui tam whistleblowers that provided insider information regarding the company&#8217;s wrongdoing.&#160; The False Claims Act allows for whistleblowers to receive a share of the government&#8217;s settlement as a reward for exposing fraud.&#160; Here, the whistleblowers&#8217; reward for sounding the alarm on Pfizer&#8217;s misconduct was approximately $102 million, which will be shared among the six of them.</p>

				<p>On December 23, 2009, the U.S. Department of Justice <a title="Department of Justice Announces Boston Scientific Settlement" href="http://www.justice.gov/usao/ma/Press%20Office%20-%20Press%20Release%20Files/Dec2009/GuidantPR.html" target="_blank">announced</a> that it had reached an agreement with Boston Scientific Corporation in which the company would agree to pay the Government $22 million to settle a lawsuit alleging that its subsidiary, Guidant Corporation, paid <a title="Types Ff Health Care Fraud" href="http://www.fraudfighters.net/false-claims-act-fraud/healthcare-fraud/" target="_blank">kickbacks</a> to physicians through post-market studies to induce physicians to implant Guidant pacemakers and defibrillators.&#160; Post-market studies are intended to assess the performance of a medical device after it has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration.&#160; The lawsuit alleges that Guidant paid physicians who favored pacemakers and defibrillators manufactured by the company&#8217;s competitors between $1,000 and $1,500 to participate in the post-market studies, which involved implanting a number of Guidant pacemakers and defibrillators, in order to entice these doctors to switch to Guidant devices.&#160; As part of the settlement, Boston Scientific has also agreed to enter into a corporate integrity agreement which, among other things, requires the company to publicly disclose on its website payments to physicians.</p>
